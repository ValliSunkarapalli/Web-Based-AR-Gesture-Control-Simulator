# Web-Based AR Gesture Control Simulator

An interactive web application that uses real-time hand gesture recognition to enable intuitive control of virtual objects and interfaces through Augmented Reality (AR) directly in the browser.

## Features

- Real-time hand gesture detection including swipe, grab, point, and rotate.
- 3D AR visualization of virtual objects controlled by gestures.
- Runs entirely in the web browser using WebXR â€” no installation or special hardware needed.
- Responsive and user-friendly interface for seamless interaction.
- Optional backend support for storing gesture data and simulation settings.

## Technologies Used

- **MediaPipe** & **TensorFlow.js** for hand gesture detection and tracking.
- **Three.js** & **WebXR** for 3D rendering and AR integration.
- **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS** for frontend development.
- **Flask** (optional) for backend data management.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser with WebXR support (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
- (Optional) Python and Flask for backend features.
